Welcome to my Cyclistic case study. In this case study, I explored how a bike-share company can leverage data to drive success using SQL for data analysis and Tableau for visualization. Through this project, I examined key usage patterns, identified trends, and uncovered insights that can help improve service efficiency and user engagement. By analyzing ride data, customer segments, and seasonal trends, this study provides actionable recommendations for business growth. You willfind the SQL queries for 3 processes namely, pre-cleaning, full cleaning and analyzing.
